These commands creates a new network group
config
set firewall group network-group IP_BLOCKS description 'IP_COUNTRY_Blocks'
commit;save;exit

These commnads add IP ranges to the network group
configure
set firewall group network-group IP_BLOCKS network 1.0.0.0/24
set firewall group network-group IP_BLOCKS network 1.0.1.0/24
commit;save;exit

To get to scripts in edge router:
cd /config/scripts

Gets a list of ipset commands:
sudo ipset help

Create network group:
configure
set firewall group network-group Nets4-BlackList

Add to ipset rules:
sudo ipset -exist add Nets4-BlackList 2.0.0.0/24

Delete from ipset rules:
sudo ipset -exist del Nets4-BlackList 1.0.0.0/24

list ip ranges in ipset:
sudo ipset list Nets4-BlackList

**********************Creating An IP Block Script***************
Create a network group
configure
set firewall group network-group Nets4-BlackList
commit
save
exit

login into router console using a web browser
Go to Firewall/Nat>Firewall-Policies>WAN_IN>Actions>Edit Ruleset
Add Rule>Description
type Block_Countries
Check Enable
Action drop
Protocol All protocols
Advanced
State Check Established, New, Related
Source Check select address group then Nets4-BlackList
Destination leave blank
save rule
Make sure the rule is at the top of the list of firewall rules

On the router go to
cd /config/scripts
vi addipblock.sh
enter the following code into the vi editor and save (do this if multiple ip lists are loaded):
for i in `cat /config/scripts/countryblockips.txt|egrep '^[0-9]'|egrep '/'`;
do ipset -exist add Nets4-Blacklist $i;
done
chmod 777 addipblock.sh

upload the countryblockips.txt script using filezilla type one
ip range per line example
1.0.0.0/24
2.0.0.0/24
host:routerip
enter routers username
enter routers password
port 22
quickconnect

once the file has been uploaded to the router run the following command and save the
file in dos2unix this removes any symbols or text which might not work with
the routers linux os
dos2unix countryblockip.txt
save

run this command to load blacklist into routers firewall.
cd /config/scripts
sudo ./addipblock.sh

run this command to verify that the ips have been added to the list
sudo ipset list Nets4-BlackList

******************************For IPV6 Firewall Configure*****************
configure
set firewall group ipv6-network-group Nets6-BlackList description 'Blacklisted IPv6 Sources'
edit firewall ipv6-name WANv6_IN
set rule 1 description "IPV6 Country Block"
set rule 1 action drop
set rule 1 protocol all
set rule 1 source group ipv6-network-group Nets6-BlackList
save
commit
save
exit

After the load script has run use this command to see if the ipv6
rules have been added to the firewall
sudo ipset list Nets6-BlackList

run this command to configure the router to run the addipblock.sh
when the router is rebooted (this has to be done because ipset tables
are erased once the router reboots)
crontab -e
go to the bottom press o to insert a new line at the bottom type
@reboot sleep 180 && sudo /config/scripts/addipblock.sh
to save type :wq

Example contab config file:

 Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
#
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task
#
# To define the time you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow) or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
#
# For more information see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
#
# m h  dom mon dow   command
@reboot sleep 180 && sudo /config/scripts/addipblock.sh
